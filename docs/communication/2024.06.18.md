## This Meeting  

- Nice-to-have
  - Have all error handling run through toast so that the user can see the errors
  - Varying number of points per question is a stretch goal
- Decided not to make the bubble-sheet preview in the interest of time. This is not really required and can be a stretch goal.
- Reminder to everyone to be more explicit with frontend tests
- OMR
  - Idea is to combine openCV and YOLO
  - Fran is doing the exploratory work.
