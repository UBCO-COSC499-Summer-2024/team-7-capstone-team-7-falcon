## This Meeting  

- Reviewed PRs and reviewed the project board
- Updates on OMR training
  - Fran ran into issues (installation issues and lack of documentation) but now has a model trained for 50 epochs. Training is slow, but we will hopefully get results soon.
- Discussed blockers
  - UI: the reusable table component
    - Already spent a week on this feature
    - There are two libraries that can be used: 'react table library' and 'react table'
      - The react table library is too opinionated and it is hard for us to modify it for our needs, especially for pagination
    - Bennett to write the component 'from scratch' since he spent time reading the documentation for the tables.
- Main tasks due by Thursday:
  - Table skeleton should be done and implement tables for all endpoints that are ready
  - Student dashboard endpoints
  - Complete authentication (at least enough for review)

## Action Items

- Team to update logs before the end of the day. They need to be merged by 8:30 am tomorrow.
