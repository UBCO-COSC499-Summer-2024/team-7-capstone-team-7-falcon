## This Meeting  

- Reviewed PRs and reviewed the project board
  - There was an issue with archived issues not being taken into account when generating the burn up chart.
    - Fixed by adding a new  `archived` label. We can then filter issues with this label out.

- Progress updates
  - OMR
    - OpenCV-related work is pretty much done.
    - Still need to fix the OMR model
