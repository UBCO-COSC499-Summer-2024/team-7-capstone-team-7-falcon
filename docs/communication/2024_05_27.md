  - Some more stretch goals:
    - Supporting multiple correct answers per question (see Scott's message below).

  - Decided that our SMART goals would be our success criteria.

  - Assigned sections to each member

## Action Items

## Additional Notes

- Items which require a response/action from Scott:
  - Bubble sheet templates
  - Team/Individual logs templates

- Canvas Response from Scott:
  - **Are multiple correct answers allowed per question?** In general with MCQs, it is possible to have more than one correct answer per row and each selection could have its own unique point value (ie marked separately) or it could be that the entire question needs to be correct in order to get the point (this is potentially unique to each exam, so would work to decouple it from the rest of the system); Something that you may want to consider (from a design perspective) is that you could have a specific definition (structure plan) for each exam that is used for the generation of the sheet, marking as well as the presentation of how the information is stored in the system.
  - **Can more than one teacher teach a course?** Yes, it it most likely that there will be more than one instructor/TA for the course.

- Scott's Discord responses:
  - **Do we need tests for the design document?** Was a typo, not needed.
  - **Are the SMART goals and success criteria the same?** These can form the foundation for success criteria; think about what the user and system need to do.   You could add this as a summary table for the success criteria (in additon to listing out your objectives and success criteria).   Often, Measurable Objectives and Success Criteria must include a number of measurable items that you might want to record separately.
