## Last Meeting (Restrospective)

N/A

## This Meeting  

- During class today:
  - Scott said that we could have our own clockify account and just add him and the TAs.
  - Scott confirmed that the logging cycles really are 2-day and 5-day cycles.
- Discussed UI/UX design ideas.
- Other ideas which came up during the meeting:
  - We should provide the option to modify the answer key to the teachers.
    - Even if the option of generating a customized bubble sheet was selected, we should still provide the option to upload a PDF of an answer key to account for changes.
  - We will not be storing the PDFs in the database. The JSON should be enough.
  - Possibly add a different role for TAs.
    - They should not have the option to delete a course.
  - We should consider offering the option to clone courses/exams.

## Action Items

- Fran to add the TAs to clockify.
- Everyone to continue working on their assigned tasks for the design document.
- We are all meeting Ramon at 2 p.m. today for the review.
