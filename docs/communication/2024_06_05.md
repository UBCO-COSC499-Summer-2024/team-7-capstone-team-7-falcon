## This Meeting  

- Discussed routing and layout.
  - Separate student and instructor views even when they share the same pages. Helps with:
    - Clarity
    - More secure.
- Information Dima got from Ramon and Scott:
  - "looking at canvas csv format, it wouldnâ€™t be possible to adjust formatting for it. So he just suggested student id and grade"
  - The team is free to use openCV or a pretrained model.
  - The mobile UI for the students can be a bonus feature.
- In class today:
  - We need some running code + docker set up for Friday.
  - We need around ~10 features per week, i.e. 2-3 features by member
  - Getting YOLOv3 to work will probably be hard.
  - Suggestions:
    - Explore [Llava](https://llava-vl.github.io/)
      - Version 1.6 is stable
      - No need for GPU
    - Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning
    - [Phi 3 vision](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct)
