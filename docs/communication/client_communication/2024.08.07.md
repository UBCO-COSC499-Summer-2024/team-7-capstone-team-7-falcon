## Notes

- Demo'ed the application.
- Client feedback:
  - Ramon thinks we have nice features, and nice UI 
    - Thinks we have a functional and 'visually good' website
  - He appreciates that our OMR model works well at least on the UBC sheets
    - Thinks we can test the application in a course using UBC sheets
      - In the worse case, we can default back to the Scantron
  - Wondered about the access controls for the submissions
    - The middleware makes sure that users will not be able to access submissions directly
  - Wondered if there were checks in place to prevent students not registered in a course from enrolling in it
    - There is no incentive for students to do so since the application only allows them to view their own submissions and there is no other accessible course data
