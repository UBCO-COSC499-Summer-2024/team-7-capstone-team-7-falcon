# Recorded observations for the second round of peer testing

## Testing Round 1

### Participant names

- Cormac

### Participant reactions and questions

Likes the pdf viewer (student view)
Easily found the dispute grade button. Thinks it is a cool feature.
Lots of nods
Create exam with custom bubble sheet - was a tad bit lost as to what the steps were. We might want to make it clearer that creating custom bubble sheets is optional.  
Toggling the visibility of the grades - had trouble finding the button.
Overall, thinks that the website looks 'very nice'.

## Testing Round 2

### Participant names

- Bridgett

### Participant reactions and questions

- Suggested we make sure that the numbering for the bubbles on the dispute page are aligned.
- Was confused about where the button to edit the grade of the student was. Thinks that the usability of the edit bubble sheet feature for the disputes is low. It is very unintuitive.
- Suggested to add a home button
- Suggested to move the back button to the left
- Suggested to center the calendar components (admin)
- Suggested to make it not possible to select invalid dates instead of adding validation later.

## Testing Round 3

### Participant names

- Someone from team 2?

### Participant reactions and questions

- Lots of nods
- Thinks that the custom bubble sheet functionality is 'cool'
- Was lost - had trouble finding the button to hide the exam grades

## Testing Round 4

### Participant names

- Bhavya

### Participant reactions and questions

- Thinks that the text in the navigation bar is 'too grey' and not visible enough
- Wondered about there being any way to add students using an invite URL
- Also thought it was hard to find out where to edit the grade of a student (dispute page).
- Creating custom bubble sheet: thought that the user had to follow the format of "min" and "max" number. Can this be made more intuitive?

## Testing Round 5

### Participant names

- Jusnoor
- Bennett

### Participant reactions and questions

- Participant 2 was able to perform all the tasks easily
- Finding a graded exam - user went to the "my exams" tab - probably add to FAQ

## Testing Round 6

### Participant names

- Thivina
- Patrick

### Participant reactions and questions

- Suggestion to have a 'loading' animation in case loading pages takes a while
- Suggestion to have some kind of feedback after a custom bubble sheet is created - how does it couple with the exam? We need to add this to the FAQ (that these two features are decoupled)
- participants thought the website looked 'very good'
- Since the text on the navbar is 'greyed out', the user thought they were not clickable.
- Finding graded exams - was not immediately obvious to user (they did not notice the filter in the table).

## Testing Round 7

### Participant names

- Jay

### Participant reactions and questions

- A bit lost as to how the bubble sheet worked (needed to explain that it is decoupled from the exam)
- Also had a little trouble finding the button to hide grades

## Testing Round 8

### Participant names

- Ahmad

### Participant reactions and questions

- course settings button doesn't work on the instructor view submission page
- back button on instructor view submission page is jumping back 2 pages instead of 1

- Wondered about there being any way to import students?
- student submission bubblesheet view is letting students edit the grade
- bubblesheet frontend UI not intuitive - prefers a save button instead of hitting enter to save

## Testing Round 9

### Participant names

- Jiayai

### Participant reactions and questions

- Numbering of table elements - we are currently using the primary key id from the database, but from a user perspective, the numbers are expected to be sequential without any gaps.
- Prompt for user confirmation for the danger zones
- Overall, good. 

## Testing Round 10

### Participant names

- Bowen

### Participant reactions and questions

- She would like to have a side by side view to see what the actual answer key is and what the student marksheet is to verify their answers
- Grade overview is a little confusing since it's catering to only low (statistics) ex - low = 50
- Create course button is too far (maybe shift to the left)
- instructions/tooltips to fill out the bubbles or provide the answer key
- Add a modal or pop up to let the instructors know that the answer key is downloading 
- Some notification system or make it intuitive to let the instructor know that the bubble sheet is already generated
- The system should keep track of created bubble sheets

## Testing Round 11

### Participant names

- Omar

### Participant reactions and questions

- No issues noted
