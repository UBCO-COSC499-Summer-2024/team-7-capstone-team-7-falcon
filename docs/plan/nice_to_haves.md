# Nice-to-haves

This is a (growing) list of nice-to-haves that the team has identified.

- System onboarding
- Monitoring system performance and usage
- Allowing instructors to upload a CSV file of students for student registration
- Accounting for large class sizes
- Changing the weighting of questions in an exam after it has been graded
- Accounting for multiple versions of the same exam. For instance, a PSYO section having Version A and Version B of a midterm.
- Supporting multiple correct answers per question
- Allowing a questions in an exam to be assigned different points.
- Adding a slider for light/dark theme. We can easily do that in tailwind/flowbite.
