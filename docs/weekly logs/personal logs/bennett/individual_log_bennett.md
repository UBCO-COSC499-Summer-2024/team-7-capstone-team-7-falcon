### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I completed task #1. I also read up on flowbite and tailwind but it is not a task. Everything I am working on is going well.

The process is going smoothly, the team is using the project board effectively to assign work.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Work on frontend pages for letting a logged in student join a course 
  * Create more front end tasks as issues.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I completed task #1 and almost finished task #2. Everything I am working on is going well.

Overall, the tasks I worked on took fairly long to complete even though they were not very technically demanding because of the large technology
learning curve. Since there are many technologies on our tech stack I haven't used before I expect the first 2 weeks of programming to take a lot
longer.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Finish Creating course endpoints in NestJS
  * Work on Mini-presentation
  * Read tailwind documentation
  * Read about NextJS middleware
