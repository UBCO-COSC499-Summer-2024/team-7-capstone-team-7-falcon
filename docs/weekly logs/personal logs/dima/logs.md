### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

I have completed Google OAuth on backend pretty early in the cycle. This allowed me to have extra time to add new features including:
 - Editing user details (backend)
 - Creating semesters (backend)
 - Sidebar navigation (frontend)
 - Allowing users to join the course with an invite link (backend).

So far our team is on track completing Milestone goals before the deadline. It took us some time to familiarize us team members with a tech stack on expectations of code base and design.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Prepare for mini presentation on Friday
  * Review pull requests of other team members
  * Look into queue system service implementation on backend
