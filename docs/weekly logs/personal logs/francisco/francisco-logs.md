### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I was not able to finish everything I wanted for the week, authorization issues on the backend and delays in some deliverables caused slow progress

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * OMR Model Start
  * Finish Backend Integration
  * Bubblesheet creation Start
