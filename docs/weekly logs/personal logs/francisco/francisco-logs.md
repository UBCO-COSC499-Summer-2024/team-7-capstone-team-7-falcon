## Friday (6/19-6/20)

### Timesheet

### Current Tasks (Provide sufficient detail and include t-shirt size)
  1. Labeling the training corpus for the OMR model
  2. Implementing openCV edge detection and masking to supplement the model training  

### Progress Update (since 6/19/2024)
![ProjectBoard](06.19_06.21/board.png)

  1. Finished creating a corpus for labeling and training
  2. Implemented a utility which handles PDFs and converts them into PIL Image Objects for saving or further processing
  3. Scaffolded a component solution with a teammate

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I was able to implement the conversion utility which also helped me prepare the corpus for labeling, Some small changes to the dockerfile were also necessary for the utility to work in the container but it went smoothly and tests all passed. The process is going well, image labeling is tedious.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  1. Have all of the images Labeled
  2. Have a model trained on the corpus
  3. Have bubble row slicing and masking implemented (if objects are properly detected by the model)

### Current Tasks (Provide sufficient detail and include t-shirt size)
  1. Creating a Training Corpus for the YOLO model
  2. Programming backend preprocessing for uploaded files to OMR (i.e. ensuring right file types and file handling)
  3. Implementing openCV edge detection and some masking to supplement the model training  

### Progress Update (since 6/14/2024) 
![ProjectBoard](06.14_06.19/board.png)

  1. Finished Instructor Dashboard
  2. Finished Front end course creation
  3. Added API endpoints for the front end

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I was able to complete my main front end goals, and was able to help teammates with issues they are having with frontend tasks.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  1. Have the file preprocessing done 
  2. Have the corpus examples completed for image labeling

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I was not able to finish everything I wanted for the week, authorization issues on the backend and delays in some deliverables caused slow progress

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * OMR Model Start
  * Finish Backend Integration
  * Bubblesheet creation Start
