Majority of the Component/Table feature is implemented. I was able to complete most of the tasks, however, need to fetch data from API to be able to merge this PR

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)

  * I am going to work on the other half of Student Exam page(UI)
