## Current Tasks

1. Make fixes to Admin Dashboard page while calling API endpoints from backend
2. Feature for admins to be able to edit user information and deactivate account.
3. Pull new changes for Course Settings page and modify it.

## Progress update since (7/12)

1. Pushed some new changes to Course Settings page,which was later refactored by Dima in his PR as he found some bugs.
2. Addressed Dima's comments on the Admin Dashboard page and refactored the code.
3. Reviewed a couple PRs for the Peer Testing.

## Cycle Goal Review

I didn't make a lot of progress in this cycle due to midterm exam, however, I have a pretty good idea on the next feature. I am still working on the changes for my current PRs so hopefully they will be merged soon to the development.

## Next Cycle Goal

My main goal would be to address current comments on the Admin Dashboard and Course Settings page. I will also work on Edit User Information page for Admin but it wont be completed by Friday.

## Friday (7/10 - 7/11)

## Current Tasks

1. Connect frontend admin dashboard page to the backend endpoints
2. Finish Course Settings page and test the implementation

### Progress update since (7/10)
1. I connected the Admin dashboard layout page to the backend endpoints and got the functionality working.
2. I finished the Course Settings implementation and fixed the test fail error.

## Cycle Goal Review

Overall,I am quite satisfied that I managed to get both features working except minor fixes that I saw during the PR review. I am ready to start a new feature once I make small changes and my PRs are merged to development branch. 

## Next Cycle Goal

I am ready to start on Admin settings page. I haven't assigned myself a new task yet but I will most probably work on Admin settings page or analytics page.

## Current Tasks
1. Finish implementing the Edit course component to the edit course page.
2. Start working on Admin Dashboard
3. Create Navbar component for Admin

## Progress update since (03-07)
1. I created the Accordion component for Student and Instructor FAQ pages
2. I implemented the component and added styling changes and some extra functionalities for FAQ pages
3. I created the edit course component that will be implemented in the Course Settings Page
4. I used the Table Component to create User Table for instructor and hooked it to the endpoint.
5. I reviewed some of the PRs that got merged for the demo (MVP)

## Cycle Goal Review

I did spend a lot of hours understanding the existing code to be able to work on Course Settings page. I also did my FAQ PRs merged into dev, and did manage to create a PR for Course Settings component. I also created the User Table from the existing table component code. Mainly, I had to spend time in understanding the API endpoints since I worked on hooking them with frontend. 

### Next Goal Cycle

I am hoping to get my Course Settings PR merged into development. I am also planning to finish Admin dashboard pages and review some of the other code for PR reviews.

## Current Tasks

1. Make changes to the User Table Component.
2. Implement the Arcordion component into both instructor and student FAQs and add some Tailwind classes
3. Start working on Course Settings Page.

## Progress update since (28-06)

1. I created the Arcordion component for FAQ pages for both instructor and students.
2. I added some mock data to the FAQ pages which further needs some styling,
3. I made some changes to the UserTable page.
4. I reviewed some of the backend code to work on hooking up some frontend pages with backend endpoints.

### Cycle Goal Review

I am happy that my PR got merged for the FAQ pages, which was pretty much creating a component and implementing it on different pages. However, I still need to address some concerns in the User Table page. I was expecting to get a little more done, but encountered some errors that took a lot of time.

### Next Goal Cycle

I am hoping to make a decent progress in the Course Settings Page. I want to make sure that both the FAQ pages, and User Table page is ready for the demo.

### Current Tasks
#1. Create table instances for the current edited Table Component
#2. Do styling fixes for the instances and make sure it matches the UI
#3. Review PRs for other tasks.

### Progress update since (21-06)
#1. I implemented pagination, vertical scrolling feature to the standard table component
#2. I had frequent discussion with Benett regarding fetching data for the table components.
#3. I worked on adding custom styling to one standard table component.


### Cycle Goal Review 
I made a decent progress on the table component as we had to refactor the whole code so that we can implement pagination. Due to finals, I wasn't able to finish connecting 
the endpoints to the table but I have much better idea on it. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * I am going to finish creating table instances with the new Table component.
  * I am going to make styling changes and make sure the tables are ready for instructor and student dashboard. 
  * I am going to review code for the PRs that are ready to be merged.
