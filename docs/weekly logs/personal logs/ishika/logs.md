### Current Tasks
#1. Get Table/Component PR merged into development(resolve any conflicts or make changes if needed)
#2. Continue working on the FAQ page
#3. Review PRs for other tasks.

### Progress update since (21-06)
#1. I hooked other tables with the API endpoints that were done.
#2. I tested tables by fetching data from the backend, and made some changes.
#3. I started working on the FAQ page.


### Cycle Goal Review 
This cycle was short so I didnt make a lot of progress. I did encounter some other axios errors that I spent a decent chunk of time troubleshooting. I finished making any relevant changes to the Component/Table branch. I also did start working on the FAQ page.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * I am going to make any changes necessary for Component/Table branch to be merged in dev branch.
  * I am going to finish the FAQ page.
  * I am going to discuss with the team on any other possible tasks needed to be completed for MVP. 
  * I am going to review code for the PRs that are ready to be merged.

### Current Tasks
#1. Create table instances for the current edited Table Component
#2. Do styling fixes for the instances and make sure it matches the UI
#3. Review PRs for other tasks.

### Progress update since (21-06)
#1. I implemented pagination, vertical scrolling feature to the standard table component
#2. I had frequent discussion with Benett regarding fetching data for the table components.
#3. I worked on adding custom styling to one standard table component.


### Cycle Goal Review 
I made a decent progress on the table component as we had to refactor the whole code so that we can implement pagination. Due to finals, I wasn't able to finish connecting 
the endpoints to the table but I have much better idea on it. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * I am going to finish creating table instances with the new Table component.
  * I am going to make styling changes and make sure the tables are ready for instructor and student dashboard. 
  * I am going to review code for the PRs that are ready to be merged.
