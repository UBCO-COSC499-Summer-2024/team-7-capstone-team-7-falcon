These tasks are completed - the PR associated with the design document just needs to be merged.

## This week's goals

This week (cycle), the focus is to complete the design document and the corresponding video with everyone.
For the next cycle, I will work on familiarising myself more with the tech stack (tons of new technology for me), and starting work on the authentication system with Dima and Ishika.
