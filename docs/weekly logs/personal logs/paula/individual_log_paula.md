### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

While linking the frontend and backend of the authentication system only required one line of code (yes, this is embarrassing), it took me much longer to figure out the specifics (overthought it) and I ended up in a NestJS rabbit hole. I started work on task #2, and Dima will help me with fixing some of the bugs in the next cycle. Task #3 is being pushed to the next cycle as well.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)

  * Work with Fran to set up user permissions for viewing pages.
  * Complete the account setup page.
  * Help more with the UI / work with Fran on the OMR backend (depending on what will be prioritised).

## Wednesday (6/7- 6/11)

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

Since I do not have previous experience using React, I was not able to contribute much this cycle. I spent more time going through the PRs and some documentation to try to understand the code. While I did go over the NextJS tutorial previously, I still found it hard to follow what the team has been doing so I ended up having to start looking into the basics of TypeScript (this is in progress).

Now that Ishika has finished the frontend and Dima the backend of the authentication system, I can start working on linking the two.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)

  * Complete the authentication system that Dima and Ishika have worked on.
  * Work with Fran to set up user permissions for viewing pages.
  * Prep for the mini-presentation on Friday.
