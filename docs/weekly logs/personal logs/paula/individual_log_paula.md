### Progress Update (since 6/7/2024)

See the image in the previous section.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

Since I do not have previous experience using React, I was not able to contribute much this cycle. I spent more time going through the PRs and some documentation to try to understand the code. While I did go over the NextJS tutorial previously, I still found it hard to follow what the team has been doing so I ended up having to start looking into the basics of TypeScript (this is in progress).

Now that Ishika has finished the frontend and Dima the backend of the authentication system, I can start working on linking the two.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)

  * Complete the authentication system that Dima and Ishika have worked on.
  * Work with Fran to set up user permissions for viewing pages.
  * Prep for the mini-presentation on Friday.
