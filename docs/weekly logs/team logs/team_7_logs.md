## Overview

The team focused on working towards completing the features required for Milestone #3, i.e. the ones required for the first round of mini-presentations. The backend has been setup and work on the frontend has started. The next cycle will focus on completing the authentication system (we need to link the frontend to the backend) and the creation of UI elements and pages.
