## Burn-up Chart (Velocity)

NOTE (1): We noticed a bug in the chart generated by GitHub so these might not be very accurate. We had to generate the chart for June 28 - July 02 to get the correct number of completed items. In addition, the issues for all of the logs required till the end of the term were opened in one go and so there are more open issues than completed ones.

NOTE(2): There was an issue with the burn up chart not reflecting our work. This was due to tasks being archived. We un-archived those to produce new ones.

## Overview

For the last two weeks, we planned to complete several tasks as described below.

| Task | Status |
| ---- | ------ |
| Backend endpoints for creating exams | Completed |
| OMR Training data creation | Completed |
| Backend Email/password authentication | Completed |
| Course Dashboard | Completed |
| OMR: Preprocessing | Completed |
| OMR: Corpus creation | Completed |
| OMR: OpenCV scripts | In Review |
| UI: Creation of reusable table components | In Review |
| OMR: model training | In Progress |
| Finish all authentication pages | In Progress |
| Instructors and TAs are able to search for course members in their course by the first and last name | In Progress |
| UI: Customise bubble sheet page | To do |
| Grade released page | To do |

While the team was not able to complete everything that we promised since more urgent tasks came up during development, we were able to complete the following additional tasks:

- Backend
  - Retrieving all exams for a course
  - Allowing instructors to retrieve submissions for an exam
  - Allowing for the retrieval of details for an exam
  - Retrieving upcoming exams for a user
  - Allowing users to see graded and upcoming exams for a course
- Frontend
  - Accordion component for FAQ page
- Create Exam page (frontend and backend integration)
- View exam results
- Various bug fixes

In Review (backend):

- Allowing users to retrieve graded exam submissions from the server
- Enforcing users to have at least one ID set in the database
- Allowing users to view their grade for an exam
- Allowing instructors to change grades
- Allowing professors and admins to edit course details

Overall, the team is collaborating well despite the roadblocks. Our focus is still the MVP, but we are cautiously optimistic about delivering everything we promised due to the unexpected blockers and bugs which came up in the last two weeks. However, we will have at least 50% of features implemented by Friday.

## Overview

For the last two cycles, we planned to complete several tasks as described below.

| Task | Status |
| ---- | ------ |
| Backend endpoints for creating exams | Completed |
| OMR Training data creation | Completed |
| Email/password authentication | In Review |
| UI: Creation of reusable table components | In Review |
| Finish all authentication pages | In Progress |
| OMR model training | In Progress  |
| UI: Customise bubble sheet page | To do |
| Instructors and TAs are able to search for course members in their course by the first and last name | To do |
| Course Dashboard | |
| Grade released page | To do |

While we did not completed all of the tasks, the team completed some other features which took precedence on those listed. Most backend endpoints for the instructor role (except analytics) have been completed and the next step is to implement those for the student role. The admin role will be our last priority. While progress has been slower this cycle due to changing requirements (in terms of UI), some bugs, and some issues building the reusable table component (this was an opportunity for the team to reflect on what went wrong), the team is on track to completing the features required for the MVP.
